This includes people who: have not yet developed symptoms (pre-symptomatic) ,never develop symptoms (asymptomatic).While experts know that these kinds of transmissions are happening among those in close contact or in close physical settings, it is not known to what extent. This means it is extremely important to follow the proven preventative measures.\n"}]}]}
